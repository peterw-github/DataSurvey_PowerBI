## Walkthrough

630 Data professionals responded to an online survey, and those results were made public. 

The survey primarily features information regarding: job title, salary, highest education level, industry, and overall happiness with their current job, in the core aspects (salary, coworkers, management, upwards mobility, etc).

I brought the raw dataset into PowerBI, cleaned it using Power Query, and then built a comprehensive dashboard, available below.
